# Running the apps in local k8s

Now that we have all our code working with Docker Compose, itâ€™s time to run it on our local Kubernetes (k8s) cluster. There are multiple options for this:

- **[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start)**
- **[Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#creating-a-cluster)** (Kubernetes in Docker)
- **[MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io)**
- **[k3s](https://k3s.io)**
- **[Rancher Desktop](https://k0sproject.io)**
- **[k0s](https://k0sproject.io)**
- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)**

I have decided to use kind for this course but it can be followed with absolutely any of these local distributions. Each of them have their tradeoffs and ultimately its our preference.

## Prerequisites

This guide provides instructions to install `kind` (Kubernetes IN Docker) and `kubectl` (Kubernetes command-line tool) on Linux using binary downloads and adding them to your system's PATH. This ensures you always have the latest versions directly from the source. Assuming `oocker` is already installed.

-----

### Installing `kind` (Kubernetes IN Docker) on Linux

1.  Get the latest `kind` release version:
  
    ```bash
    KIND_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
    echo "Latest kind version: $KIND_VERSION"
    ```

2.  Download the `kind` binary:
    
    *Note: Replace `amd64` with `arm64` if you are on an ARM-based system.*

    ```bash
    # For AMD64 / x86_64
    [ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind "https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/${KIND_VERSION}/kind-linux-amd64"

    ```

3.  Make the binary executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./kind
    ```

4.  Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

    ```bash
    sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
    ```

5.  Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    kind version
    ```

-----

### Installing `kubectl` on Linux

1.  Get the latest `kubectl` release version:

    ```bash
    KUBECTL_VERSION=$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)
    echo "Latest kubectl version: $KUBECTL_VERSION"
    ```

2.  Download the `kubectl` binary:

    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/${KUBECTL_VERSION}/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    ```

    *Note: Replace `amd64` with `arm64` if you are on an ARM-based system.*

3.  Make the binary executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    ```

4.  Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:

    ```bash
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```

5.  Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    kubectl version --client
    ```


-----

### For Windows/Mac

### For Windows:

  * Using Chocolatey (Recommended for ease):

    ```powershell
    choco install kubernetes-cli # Installs kubectl
    choco install kind # Installs kind
    ```

    Ensure Chocolatey is installed first: [https://chocolatey.org/install](https://chocolatey.org/install)

  * Using Scoop:

    ```powershell
    scoop install kubectl
    scoop install kind
    ```

    Ensure Scoop is installed first: [https://scoop.sh/](https://scoop.sh/)

### For macOS:

  * Using Homebrew (Recommended):

    ```bash
    brew install kubectl
    brew install kind
    ```

    Ensure Homebrew is installed first: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)


## Creating kind cluster

- Change directory to kind directory in the stage 1 folder
    
    ```bash
    cd stages/stage-1/kind-config
    ```

- Look at the content of the kind config file. It is being used to create a kind cluster with custom settings (more that one node in this case) 
    
    ```bash
    cat kind-config.yaml
    ```

- You can read more about customizing kind configuration here: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/configuration/

- Lets create the kind cluster

    ```bash
    cd stages/stage-1/kind-config
    kind create cluster --name apollo --config kind-config.yaml
    ```

    ![kind cluster creation](./images/cluster-create.png)

- Next run this command to cehck if cluster is running correctly:  

    ```bash
    kubectl cluster-info --context kind-apollo`
    ```

    ![kind info](./images/kind-info.png)

- Confirm the nodes are correct 
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    ![kubenodes](./images/kube-nodes.png)

- Can look at `cat ~/.kube/config` to confirm that cluster config is set correctly

- Lets try the default hello world of any k8s cluster, running the nginx image
   
    ```bash 
    kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
    ```
- You should be seeing a `pod/nginx created` output

- Confirm our pod has been created:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods
    ```
    > Note: it could be in `ContaineCreating` state for  a while until the image is retrieved locally

    ![kind nginx](./images/kind-nginx.png)

- Lets port forward that pod and check if its accessible from the terminal 

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward pod/nginx 8000:80
    ```

    This will make sure that the port 80 in the nginx pod will be exposed as port 8000 on your localhost

    ![nginx portforward](./images/nginx-portforward.png)

- Open a different terminal and try accessing the site:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000
    ```

    ![nginx output](./images/nginx-output.png)

- Lets cleanup the pod once we have tested

- Delete the pod using 
    
    ```bash
    kubectl delete pod/nginx
    ```

## Creating namespace

- Lets create a namespace named `apollo11`. All our resources will go here.
- Kubernetes namespaces provide a mechanism to logically divide cluster resources among multiple users or teams. They help organize objects and prevent naming collisions in large environments, acting as virtual clusters within a physical cluster.
> To get more info on namespaces refer: [namespaces](https://notes.darshanraul.cloud/kubernetes/concepts/namespaces)

- All of our resources will be created in that namespace [except any non namespaced resources, run `kubectl api-resources` to check ]

    ```bash
    cd stages/stage-1/manifests/namespace
    kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
    ```

    ![namespace created](./images/namespace-created.png)

- Now lets have a look if our namespace has been created. Run below command and ensure that the apollo11 namespace has been created

    ```bash
    kubectl get namespaces
    ```
    ![namespace confirm](./images/namespace-confirm.png)


## Load all the images inside kind cluster

- To run our pods inside kind, we will need to load our docker images inside kind cluster.
- This is a temporary provision until we setup a CICD in the next sections

> Note: There will be similar provisions in other local distributions as well. Also in the next stages we will be moving to private registries where these steps will be obsolete. But to start with simple setup, these are needed

- Check if you have docker images for all the 5 services and 2 databases: lunar,dashboard,timeline,commmnd,telemetry

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

    ![docker images](./images/docker-images.png)

- Once confirmed, lets load all the images into kind cluster. Kind will automatically load them to all the nodes in the cluster

    ```bash
    kind load docker-image liftoff-dashboard-app:latest --name apollo
    kind load docker-image liftoff-timeline-app:latest --name apollo
    kind load docker-image liftoff-command-dispatcher:latest --name apollo
    kind load docker-image liftoff-lunar-app:latest --name apollo
    kind load docker-image liftoff-telemetry-app:latest --name apollo
    ```

- We can confirm these are loaded by running this command on one of the node containers

    ```bash
    docker exec -it apollo-worker crictl images
    ```
    ![kind images loaded](./images/kind-images-loaded.png)

> !!! note
>
>   because this will be local images, **we need to ensure that we keep imagePullPolicy=never** when running in the local cluster to avoid any image pull business


## Creating Architecture

- If you are not a newbie and want to get done with this stage at once:
    ```bash
    cd /stages/stage-1/manifests
    kubectl apply -R -f .
    ```

## Tools

- K9s
- Kubens
- Kubectx
- jsonpathparsing
- Kompose

- There is a tool called Kompose which can be used to convert your docker compose files into k8s manifests
- Infact I used it to initially convert the docker compose file to the initial set of manifests
- Refer the docs at https://kompose.io to know more
> Note: in my observations, you will have to tweak quite a bit to make the manifests work if you have some complex usecases but for simpler applications this will work like a charm
- Just install kompose by following their guide and run `kompose convert` and you get your k8s manifests! Give it a try
