TODO: Heres the video demo of how it will look when running end to end:


# Stages

### 🧱 **launchpad – fundamentals**

---

### Stage 3 : 💾 **Mission Data Systems – persistence**

* Use ephemeral storage options like `emptyDir` and `hostPath` and understand their limitations.
* Learn what Persistent Volumes are and how storage is abstracted in Kubernetes.
* Understand reclaim policies and how Kubernetes handles storage after workloads are deleted.
* Request storage using Persistent Volume Claims and see how binding works.
* Use StorageClasses to define dynamic provisioning behavior for storage.
* Expose Pod and node metadata to applications using the Downward API.
* Run stateful applications using StatefulSets and understand their guarantees.

---

### Stage 4 : 🎛️ **Flight Control Systems – controls in place**

* Configure liveness, readiness, and startup probes to control workload health.
* Define resource requests and limits to manage CPU and memory consumption.
* Understand Quality of Service (QoS) classes and how Kubernetes prioritizes Pods under pressure.
* Control scheduling behavior using Pod Priority and Preemption.
* Enforce fair usage and prevent resource exhaustion using resource quotas.

---

### Stage 5 : 📦 **Mission Payload Integration – packaging and deployment**

* Package and template Kubernetes manifests using Helm charts.
* Customize Kubernetes configurations using Kustomize overlays and patches.
* Build CI/CD pipelines to test and deploy applications automatically.
* Implement GitOps workflows using Argo CD to manage deployments declaratively.

---

### Stage 6 : 📡 **Mission Operations (Houston) – monitoring and observability**

* Revisit probes from an operational perspective to understand real-world failure signals.
* Use DaemonSets to deploy monitoring and system agents on every node.
* Debug running Pods using ephemeral containers without restarting workloads.
* Explore the cluster visually using the Headlamp dashboard.
* Collect and query metrics using Prometheus.
* Visualize metrics and build dashboards using Grafana.
* Centralize logs using Loki and correlate them with metrics.
* Trace requests across services using OpenTelemetry.
* Systematically troubleshoot failing applications and Pods using observability data.

---

### Stage 7 : 🛰️ **Orbital Maneuvering – scaling**

* Automatically scale workloads using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).
* Control where Pods run using taints and tolerations.
* Influence scheduling decisions using node affinity rules.
* Control Pod co-location and separation using pod affinity and anti-affinity.

---

### Stage 8 : 🔐 **Command Module Hardening – security**

* Implement fine-grained access control using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* Secure Pods using security contexts to restrict privileges.
* Authenticate workloads using Service Accounts.
* Store and manage secrets securely using Vault as an external key store.
* Manage encrypted secrets using Sealed Secrets and External Secrets Operator.
* Enforce baseline security standards using Pod Security Admission.
* Manage TLS certificates automatically using cert-manager.
* Integrate Kubernetes authentication with OIDC using Keycloak.
* Control and mutate resources using admission controllers.
* Enforce policy-as-code using OPA or Kyverno.

If you want next, I can:

* Convert this into **course modules + labs**
* Add **capstone projects per stage**
* Generate **GitHub repo structure**
* Turn this into a **certification-style syllabus**

This is already *very* close to industry-grade.



## Prerequisites

- This course assumes that you come with bare basic knowledge about k8s concepts. 
- I highly recommend this playlist, will cover everything you ever need to know [varjosh k8s course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt&si=TN-MJ8-1pKj1_V4J)
