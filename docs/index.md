## Stages


### 🚀 **Liftoff** — Containers & Local Development

> *"Ignition begins with understanding containers."*

* Intro to containers & Docker
* Docker CLI, Dockerfiles, Images, Volumes
* Build & Run multi-service apps via Docker Compose
* Local workflows with `tilt` or `skaffold` for developer productivity

---

### 🧱 **Stage 1: Launch Pad** — Kubernetes Barebones

> *"Get it off the ground using the simplest cluster."*

* Intro to Kubernetes concepts: Pods, Nodes, Cluster
* Setup Kind / Minikube cluster
* Deploy simple apps via `kubectl`
* Create basic `Deployment`, `Service`, and use Namespaces

---

### 🧠 **Stage 2: Structural Integrity** — Best Practices

> *"Harden the fundamentals."*

* ConfigMaps, Secrets
* Labels, Annotations
* Init containers, sidecars
* Probes: Readiness, Liveness, Startup
* Resource requests/limits, Quotas
* Restart policies
* Scheduling: Taints/Tolerations, Node Affinity, Pod Affinity/Anti-Affinity
* SecurityContext & PodDisruptionBudgets

---

### 💾 **Stage 3: Persistent Journey** — Storage Deep Dive

> *"Save state and survive reboots."*

* Persistent Volumes & Claims
* Storage Classes
* StatefulSets
* Volume Modes & Access Modes
* Reclaim Policies (Retain, Delete, Recycle)
* CSI Drivers (brief intro)

---

### 🌐 **Stage 4: Orbit Control** — Networking in Depth

> *"Achieve stable orbit with secure comms."*

* Cluster Networking 101
* Services: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer
* Ingress Controllers & TLS Termination
* NetworkPolicies
* CoreDNS config
* Gateway API (replacing Ingress)
* Intro to Service Mesh (Linkerd or Istio lite)

---

### 📦 **Stage 5: Modular Payloads** — Packaging and Extensibility

> *"Standardize and ship the system."*

* Helm Charts (create and use)
* Kustomize for environment-based configs
* Intro to Operators
* Custom Resources / CRDs
* Helmfile / GitOps bundling patterns

---

### 🔎 **Stage 6: Mission Control** — Monitoring & Debugging

> *"Keep eyes on every subsystem."*

* `kubectl debug`, `ephemeral containers`
* Headlamp or Lens UI
* Metrics Server, API metrics
* Prometheus + Grafana
* Loki for logs
* Tempo/Jaeger for traces
* OpenTelemetry overview

---

### 🔁 **Stage 7: Flight Automation** — CI/CD and Workflows

> *"Smooth deployment across galaxies."*

* GitOps vs traditional CI/CD
* Argo Workflows / Tekton Pipelines
* ArgoCD for GitOps deployment
* Multi-env deploys via Helmfile / ArgoCD apps
* Event-driven pipelines

---

### 🔐 **Stage 8: Secure Docking** — Kubernetes Security

> *"Protect your capsule at all costs."*

* TLS/SSL & Cert Manager
* Sealed Secrets / External Secrets
* RBAC (basic to advanced)
* Vault for secrets management
* OPA / Kyverno for policies
* Keycloak for SSO / OIDC
* Tools: Kubescape, Trivy, Polaris

---

### 📈 **Stage 9: Adaptive Thrust** — Autoscaling & Optimization

> *"Match thrust with need."*

* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
* Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
* Cluster Autoscaler
* Karpenter (modern autoscaling)
* QoS Classes
* Load Testing (k6, vegeta)
* Pod Priority & Preemption

---

### 💥 **Stage 10: Contingency Mode** — Backup, Upgrades, Chaos

> *"Prepare for failure and return."*

* Backup & Restore using Velero/Rook
* Blue/Green and Canary upgrade patterns
* Minor/Major cluster version upgrades
* Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos / ChaosMesh

---

### 🌍 **Stage 11: Earth Departure** — Production-Grade Clusters

> *"Beyond the test lab."*

* CI/CD integration: GitHub Actions to push images
* Use GCR, ECR, Harbor (with pull secrets)
* IaC with Terraform/Pulumi for cluster setup
* Cluster hardening guides (NSA/CIS Benchmarks)
* Multi-cluster and Federation basics

---

### 🪐 **To Mars** — Advanced Delivery & Operations

> *"Progressive delivery and self-reliance."*

* Argo Rollouts for Canary/Blue-Green
* Progressive Delivery strategies
* Harbor – self-hosted registry with security scanning
* Cluster cost analysis (Kubecost)
* Platform Engineering intro (Backstage, Crossplane)
* Multi-tenant Kubernetes



## Prerequisites

- This course assumes that you come with bare basic knowledge about k8s concepts. 
- I highly recommend this playlist, will cover everything you ever need to know [varjosh k8s course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt&si=TN-MJ8-1pKj1_V4J)
    - Its long so you can choose what you need, if you are a complete beginner i would encourage to go through all of it from start to end
