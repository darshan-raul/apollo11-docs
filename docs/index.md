    - Reclaim Policy    
    - Statefulset

- Stage 4 - Enter Better Networking

    - Network Policies

    - Prometheus 
    - Loki
    - Open Telemetry
    - Grafana

- Stage 7 - Bring in Automation

    - Tilt for local testing
    - Argo Workflows/Tekton
        - multi env deploys
    - Argo CD

- Stage 8 - Security

    - Tls
    - Sealed secrets
    - RBAC
    --- optional
    - Keycloak
    - Vault
    - OPA
    - Kubescape

- Stage 9 - Autoscaling
    
    - HPA
    - VPA
    - Cluster Autoscaling
    - Karpenter 
    - Load Testing
    - Qos

- Stage 10 - Backup,upgrades and Chaos
    
    - Backup and restore
        - Velero/Rook
    - Cluster upgrades
    - Chaos Engineering
    
- Stage 11 - Move on from Local k8s cluster
    - github actions to push image to gcr/private repo
    - use image pull secrets to pull image

- To Mars
    - Argo Rollouts [progressive delivery]
    - Harbor - Self hosted container registry



## Prerequisites

- This course assumes that you come with bare basic knowledge about k8s concepts. 
- I highly recommend this playlist, will cover everything you ever need to know [varjosh k8s course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmPit9IIdzwRjqD-l_sZBDdPlcSfKqpAt&si=TN-MJ8-1pKj1_V4J)
    - Its long so you can choose what you need, if you are a complete beginner i would encourage to go through all of it from start to end
